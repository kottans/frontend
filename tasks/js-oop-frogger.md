# Classic Frogger Game

Ця задача є фінальним проектом курсу Udacity Object Oriented Javascript.

## Project Overview

You will be provided visual assets and a game loop engine;
using these tools you must add a number of entities 
to the game including the player characters and enemies 
to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

## Why this Project?

Games have a lot of objects, and those objects do a lot
of different things; but sometimes those objects do some
very similar things as well. This creates a great opportunity
to practice object-oriented programming, an important
programming paradigm that influences your application
architecture and provides performance optimizations.

## What will I Learn?

You will learn JavaScript’s object oriented programming 
features to write eloquently designed classes capable of 
creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects.
You will discover a variety of ways that inheritance and 
delegation can be used to create well-architected and 
performant applications.

## How Does this Help My Career?

- JavaScript enables the development of complex applications 
  on the web.
- JavaScript runs on normal web browsers, which makes it one
  of the most accessible and flexible programming languages.
- Complex applications must be “broken down” into simpler 
  entities that manage their own properties and functionality.

## How do I Complete this Project?

Here is an example of what the Frogger-like game should look like:

[Watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2JhGrrwLuQ)

1. Fork the repo with art assets and provided game engine -
   [frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)
1. Review the code and comments provided in `app.js`
1. Identify the various classes you will need to write.
1. Identify and code the properties each class must have to accomplish its tasks.
1. Write the functions that provide functionality to each of your class instances.

And here are [some more detailed instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub)
to help you get started.

Also note that:
1. The player character should not be able to move off the board.
1. The game should reset when the player character hits a bug.
1. The game should reset when the player character reaches the water.

Once done, submit the code you authored for review
just like with any other practical task before.
