# Linux, Command Line, HTTP Tools

Learn some command line, server and http tools.

1. [Linux Survival (4 modules)](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/)

   **A note for Windows users:** This course provides a virtual environment to
   type commands in. However, if you want to later use these commands in practice,
   you will need to work with Linux CLI as many commands are not supported by
   Windows `cmd` or PowerShell. You must have already installed `git`
   from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
   It offers Git Bash that can be used to type bash commands in.

   Right click anywhere in file explorer and select
   `Git Bash here` option.

2. [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177)

3. [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155)

<!-- [Web Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-development--cs253) -->
<!-- [Designing RESTful APIs](https://www.udacity.com/course/designing-restful-apis--ud388) -->

Finish the course (1) and also read articles (2) and (3) above.

When complete do the following:
1. Make a screenshot of your finished lessons from (1)
   and put the screenshot in `task_linux_cli` folder in
   your `kottans-frontend` repo
1. In your `kottans-frontend` repo `README.md`:
   * add header `## Linux CLI, and HTTP`
   * embed the screenshot or add a link to the screenshot
   * list your reflections on all subtasks
     (_what was new to you_, _what surprised you_, _what you intend to use in future_)
1. Great job! Go ahead and share your progress with others –
   post a message in [course channel][chat]:
   `Linux CLI and HTTP — #done` (or `Linux CLI and HTTP — #p2p_done` if you are p2p course student) and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**
1. Study Extra Materials below to improve your skills.
   If you feel it affects your overall course performance consider
   reverting to those later e.g. when you have all mandatory tasks completed.
1. You may skip Optional materials from this task (if any).

When you finish this task you can proceed to the next one.
