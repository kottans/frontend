# OOP exercise

Now you know a lot about JavaScript OOP. Remember that
tiny JS world? Time to use your new power.

1. Improve your tiny JS world model you forked from
   [here](https://github.com/OleksiyRudenko/a-tiny-JS-world).
   This time use your favourite JS OOP methods to keep
   your code DRY and SOLID.

   You don't need forking this time, work with the repo you've
   already got. Git keeps history for you.

When complete do the following:
1. You will require code review for this task:
   * update your code base for `A Tiny JS World`
   * publish updated code base for review
     in [FE 2019 course homeworks repo](https://github.com/kottans/frontend-2019-homeworks)
     with a PR
   * post a link to your task PR in the
     [FE Questionarium chat](https://t.me/joinchat/DmX0JAl-mh5W0jrWli8Ycw)
     and ask mentors for a code review
   * once the code review phase successfully finished
     and you have an approval from one of the mentors
     add to your `kottans-frontend/README.md`
     the header `## OOP Exercise`,
     a link to the task code base and
     a note saying `Reviewed and approved by @<mentor>`
     (use mentor's github username)
   * list your reflections on this task
     (_what was new to you_, _what surprised you_, _what you intend to use in future_)
1. You did a lot already! If you honestly finished all the previous steps then go ahead
   and share it with others –
   post a message in [course channel][chat]:
   `OOP Exercise — #done` and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**
1. Study Extra Materials below to improve your skills and
   read an article or two on OOP under the links in
   [this repo](https://github.com/OleksiyRudenko/a-tiny-JS-world/blob/master/README.md#learn-on-your-own)
