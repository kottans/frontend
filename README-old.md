<!-- For more information take a look on [syllabus](syllabus.md) -->


### Pre-Requisites

1. __English knowledge:__ a lot of the materials will be in English.
   If you do not feel confident enough in your technical English,
   take a look at [üìö –°–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä–∏ –ø–æ —Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç–µ–Ω–¥—É][frontend-dicts]

1. __An account on GitHub__ you will need a repository on GitHub to save your progress.
   More about repositories in _Task 0_.

1. __Markdown basics__: text formatting and readability matter. It's up to you to choose a particular style, but remember to make it readable. Using [markdown][markdown] in your repo is a good idea.

### Material-specific Requirements

The course includes links to different learning materials - video courses, tutorials, articles etc. We suggest the following approach to those materials:

1. __Reading:__ for each article, you are required to read please post
   the answers to the following questions in your respective repo.
   Don't worry, your answers will not be graded. It's just a way to reflect
   on what you have learned.
   - name (at least) one thing that was new to you
   - name (at least) one thing that surprised you
   - name (at least) one thing you intend to use in the future

1. __Online courses:__ finish all tasks, add your reflection
   about them into _README_.

1. __Videos:__ same as for the reading; watch the video,
   answer three questions.

### Progress Reports

We would like to know the progress of students along the way. We kindly ask you to post about your progress (finished tasks) in students chat.

### P.S. You Should Know

If you are willing to participate in the course, you need to understand that
you‚Äôll spend a lot of time building something big together ‚Äî a new way
of learning and collaborating. You‚Äôll become part of a small family
and should prepare yourself to find new friends and to invest a lot in this
friendship (as you should in any friendship).

The final task of this course will be to split into groups and create new courses
like that (and we‚Äôll never stop).

#### Our Basic Rules

* Respect for each other.
* [There is no such thing as a stupid question][wiki-stupid-question].
* Each person learns with their own speed, has different background and
  personality, please respect this.
* Communicating and understanding people that are different from you
  can be beneficial to both parties, provided mutual respect.
* We are against any discriminations by gender, age, the color of skin,
  disabilities or any other.
* We respect intellectual property - there is hard work of an author
  or a group of authors behind all materials that we use.
